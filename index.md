# Taobo Liao's User Page 
## Self-Introduction
Hi, my name is Taobo Liao. I'm a third-year ~~CSE~~ math-CS student. I'm Chinese, and I have a dog named "Xiaobao".![pet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59666193/134980727-3092fc11-eed7-46c5-a7f1-4d10b349d161.jpg)  
He is 3-years-old and never stop running.  
## Hobbies & some random stuff
I love playing video games. I really enjoy the process of appreciating others' thoughts and designs. My favorite saying is from Isshin Ashina as I've played Sekiro for hundred hours.  
> Hesitation is defeat. (迷えば敗れる。)  

Plus, here are some other things that I enjoy doing:  
- Watching movies and anime
- Playing badminton
- Cooking
- Swimming  

I sometimes watch vtubers, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/AsoulMoments) is the link for them. If you found interested, please go subscribe :)

### Some random Java code stuff  
```
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	     long i = sc.nextLong();
	     while(i != 1) {
	    	 System.out.print(i + " ");
	    	 if(i % 2 != 0) {
	    		 i = 3 * i + 1;
	    	 }else {
	    		 i = i / 2;
	    	 }
	     }
	     sc.close();
```  
## Future planning  
Here are some future goals that I want to achieve:
